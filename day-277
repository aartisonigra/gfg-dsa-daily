Given a garden with n flowers planted in a row, that is represented by an array arr[], where arr[i] denotes the height of the ith flower.You will water them for k days. In one day you can water w continuous flowers. Whenever you water a flower its height increases by 1 unit. You have to maximize the minimum height of all flowers after  k days of watering.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], k = 2, w = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum height after watering is 2.
Day 1: Water the last two flowers -> arr becomes [2, 3, 4, 6, 2]
Day 2: Water the last two flowers -> arr becomes [2, 3, 4, 7, 3]
Input: arr[] = [5, 8], k = 5, w = 1
Output: 9
Explanation: The minimum height after watering is 9.
Day 1 - Day 4: Water the first flower -> arr becomes [9, 8]
Day 5: Water the second flower -> arr becomes [9, 9]

  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public int maxMinHeight(int[] arr, int k, int w) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int low = 0, high = (int)1e9, ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canReachMinHeight(arr, n, k, w, mid)) {
                ans = mid; // this mid is possible, try higher
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // not possible, try lower
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private boolean canReachMinHeight(int[] arr, int n, int k, int w, int targetHeight) {
        int[] water = new int[n + 1]; // difference array
        int totalWater = 0;
        int add = 0; // current water added up to i

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            add += water[i];
            int currentHeight = arr[i] + add;

            if (currentHeight < targetHeight) {
                int diff = targetHeight - currentHeight;
                totalWater += diff;
                if (totalWater > k) return false;

                add += diff;
                if (i + w < n) {
                    water[i + w] -= diff;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
