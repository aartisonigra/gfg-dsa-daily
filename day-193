Given a 2D array jobs[][] of size n × 3, where each row represents a single job with the following details:

jobs[i][0] : Start time of the job
jobs[i][1] : End time of the job
jobs[i][2] : Profit earned by completing the job
Find the maximum profit you can earn by scheduling non-overlapping jobs.

Note: Two jobs are said to be non-overlapping if the end time of one job is less than or equal to the start time of the next job. If a job ends at time X, another job can start exactly at time X.

Examples:

Input: jobs[][] =  [[1, 2, 50], 
                 [3, 5, 20],
                 [6, 19, 100],
                 [2, 100, 200]] 
Output: 250
Explanation: The first and fourth jobs with the time range [1, 2] and [2, 100] can be chosen to give maximum profit of 50 + 200 = 250.
Input: jobs[][] =  [[1, 3, 60], 
                 [2, 5, 50],
                 [4, 6, 70],
                 [5, 7, 30]] 
Output: 130
Explanation: The first and third jobs with the time range [1, 3] and [4, 6] can be chosen to give maximum profit of 60 + 70 = 130.

                else{

            }
            int cur = jobs[i][2];
            if(e!=-1) cur += dp[e];
            
            if(ans<cur) ans = cur;
            dp[i] = ans;
            
        }
        return ans;
