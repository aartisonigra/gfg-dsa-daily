Given a floor of dimensions 2 x n and tiles of dimensions 2 x 1, the task is to find the number of ways the floor can be tiled. A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e as a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e as 2 x 1 tile. 

Note: Two tiling arrangements are considered different if the placement of at least one tile differs.

Examples :

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We need 3 tiles to tile the board of size 2 x 3.
We can tile in following ways:
1) Place all 3 tiles vertically.
2) Place first tile vertically and remaining 2 tiles horizontally.
3) Place first 2 tiles horizontally and remaining tiles vertically.

Input: n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: We need 4 tiles to tile the board of size 2 x 4.
We can tile in following ways:
1) All 4 vertical
2) All 4 horizontal
3) First 2 vertical, remaining 2 horizontal.
4) First 2 horizontal, remaining 2 vertical.
5) Corner 2 vertical, middle 2 horizontal.


  SOLUTIONS:
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWays(int n) {
        // code here
        Map<Integer,Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        
        return find(hm,n);
    }
    private int find(Map<Integer,Integer> hm, int n){
        if(n == 0) return 1;
        if(n < 0) return 0;
        if(hm.containsKey(n)) return hm.get(n);
        
        int ans = find(hm,n-1) + find(hm,n-2);
        hm.put(n,ans);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
