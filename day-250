There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array arr[]. You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating than their neighbors get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

Note: The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: Children at index 0 and 2 will get 2 candies each as their rating is higher than index 1, and index 1 will get 1 candy. Thus total candies = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively. The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public int minCandy(int arr[]) {
       
        
        int n = arr.length;
        
        int left[] = new int[n];
        int right[] = new int[n];
        
        Arrays.fill(left,1);
        Arrays.fill(right,1);
        
        for(int i = 1; i< arr.length; i++)
        {
            if(arr[i] > arr[i-1])
            {
                left[i] += left[i-1];
            }
            
        }
        
        for(int i = arr.length - 2; i>=0; i--)
        {
            if(arr[i] > arr[i+1])
            {
                right[i] += right[i+1];
            }
        }
        
        int maxCandies = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i<left.length; i++)
        {
            maxCandies += Math.max(left[i], right[i]);
        }
        return maxCandies;
    
    }
}
