Given an array arr[] where each element denotes the length of a board, and an integer k representing the number of painters available. Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit length of a board.

Determine the minimum amount of time required to paint all the boards, under the constraint that each painter can paint only a contiguous sequence of boards (no skipping or splitting allowed).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 35
Explanation: The optimal allocation of boards among 3 painters is - 
Painter 1 → [5, 10] → time = 15
Painter 2 → [30] → time = 30
Painter 3 → [20, 15] → time = 35
Job will be done when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(15, 30, 35) = 35
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: A valid optimal partition is - 
Painter 1 → [10, 20, 30] → time = 60
Painter 2 → [40] → time = 40
Job will be complete at time = max(60, 40) = 60
Input: arr[] = [100, 200, 300, 400], k = 1
Output: 1000
Explanation: There is only one painter, so the painter must paint all boards sequentially. The total time taken will be the sum of all board lengths, i.e., 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1000.

  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public int minTime(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        
        int low = 0, high = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            low = Math.max(low, arr[i]); // max single board length
            high += arr[i];              // sum of all boards
        }
        
        int result = high;
        
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            if(isPossible(arr, k, mid)) {
                result = mid;      // possible to paint in mid time
                high = mid - 1;    // try to find smaller time
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;     // need more time
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    // Check if boards can be painted by k painters in maxTime
    private boolean isPossible(int[] arr, int k, int maxTime) {
        int painters = 1;
        int currTime = 0;
        
        for(int length : arr) {
            if(currTime + length <= maxTime) {
                currTime += length;
            } else {
                painters++;
                currTime = length;
                
                if(painters > k) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
