A beautiful matrix is defined as a square matrix in which the sum of elements in every row and every column is equal. Given a square matrix mat[][], your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the matrix beautiful.
In one operation, you are allowed to increment the value of any single cell by 1.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2], 
                [3, 4]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Increment value of cell(0, 0) by 3, 
Increment value of cell(0, 1) by 1. 
Matrix after the operations: [[4, 3], 
                            [3, 4]]
Here, sum of each row and column is 7.
Hence total 4 operation are required.
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 2, 3],
                [3, 2, 1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Increment value of cell(0, 0) by 1, 
Increment value of cell(0, 1) by 2, 
Increment value of cell(2, 1) by 1, 
Increment value of cell(2, 2) by 2. 
Matrix after the operations: [[2, 4, 3], 
                            [4, 2, 3],
                            [3, 3, 3]] 
Here, sum of each row and column is 9.
Hence total 6 operation are required.

    public:
    int balanceSums(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int n = mat.size();
        if(!n) return 0;
        int mxValue = 0, m = mat[0].size();
        
        // retrieving the maximum value from row or column
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int cur=0;
            for(int j=0; j<m; j++)  cur += mat[i][j];
            mxValue = max(mxValue, cur);
        }
        
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
            int cur=0;
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++)  cur += mat[j][i];
            mxValue = max(mxValue, cur);
        }
        
        // adjusting all row or columns to that max Value
        int ans=0;
        for(vector<int> cur: mat)
            ans += mxValue - accumulate(cur.begin(), cur.end(), 0);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
