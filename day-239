Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.
Note: You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

  SOLUTIONS:


class Solution {
    public void sort012(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while (mid <= high) {
            if (arr[mid] == 0) {
                // swap arr[low] and arr[mid]
                int temp = arr[low];
                arr[low] = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = temp;

                low++;
                mid++;
            } 
            else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } 
            else { // arr[mid] == 2
                // swap arr[mid] and arr[high]
                int temp = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = arr[high];
                arr[high] = temp;

                high--;
            }
        }
    }
}
