You are given two strings s1 and s2, of equal lengths. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

Note: A string is a rotation of another if it can be formed by moving characters from the start to the end (or vice versa) without rearranging them.

Examples :

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
Output: true
Explanation: After 2 right rotations, s1 will become equal to s2.
Input: s1 = "aab", s2 = "aba"
Output: true
Explanation: After 1 left rotation, s1 will become equal to s2.
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "acbd"
Output: false
Explanation: Strings are not rotations of each other.


  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution:
    def areRotations(self, s1, s2):
        # If lengths are different, not rotations
        if len(s1) != len(s2):
            return False

        # Join s1 with itself and check
        return s2 in (s1 + s1)
