Given a number n, find the maximum possible LCM that can be obtained by selecting three numbers less than or equal to n.
Note : LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple.

Examples:

Input: n = 9
Output: 504
Explanation: 504 is the maximum LCM that can be attained by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 9. The triplet which has this LCM is {7, 8, 9}.
Input: n = 7
Output: 210
Explanation: 210 is the maximum LCM that can be attained by any triplet of numbers less than or equal 7. The triplet which has this LCM is {5, 6, 7}.


  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
  public:
    int hcf_fun(int a, int b){
        if(b==0)
          return a;
        return hcf_fun(b, a%b);
    }
    
    int lcm_fun(int a, int b){
        return (a*b)/hcf_fun(a, b);
    }
    
    int lcmTriplets(int n) {
        // code here
        if(n<3)
          return n;
        
        if(n&1)
          return lcm_fun(n, lcm_fun(n-1, n-2));
        return max(lcm_fun(n, lcm_fun(n-1, n-3)), lcm_fun(n-1, lcm_fun(n-2, n-3))); 
    }
};
