Given a sorted array arr[] (0-index based) of distinct integers and an integer k, find the index of k if it is present in the arr[]. If not, return the index where k should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 6], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 5 is found at index 2 as arr[2] = 5, the output is 2.
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 6], k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The element 2 is not present in the array, but inserting it at index 1 will maintain the sorted order.
Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 7, 10, 14], k = 15
Output: 5
Explanation: The element 15 is not present in the array, but inserting it after index 4 will maintain the sorted order


  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public int searchInsertK(int arr[], int k) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            if (arr[mid] == k) {
                return mid; // element found
            } 
            else if (arr[mid] < k) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } 
            else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        // if not found, low is the insert position
        return low;
    }
}
