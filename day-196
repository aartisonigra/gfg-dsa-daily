Given an array arr[], where the ith element of arr[] represents the price of a stock on the ith day (all prices are non-negative integers). Find the maximum profit you can make by buying and selling stocks such that after selling a stock, you cannot buy again on the next day (i.e., there is a one-day cooldown).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, 2, 1, 2, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation: You first buy on day 1, sell on day 2 then cool down, then buy on day 4, and sell on day 5. The total profit earned is (2-0) + (3-2) = 3, which is the maximum achievable profit.
Input:  arr[] = [3, 1, 6, 1, 2, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation: You first buy on day 2 and sell on day 3 then cool down, then again you buy on day 5 and then sell on day 6. Clearly, the total profit earned is (6-1) + (4-2) = 7, which is the maximum achievable profit

  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int arr[]) {
        // Code here
        int n = arr.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        long dp0 = 0;           
        long dp1 = -arr[0];     
        long dp2 = 0;           
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            long price = arr[i];
            long prev0 = dp0, prev1 = dp1, prev2 = dp2;
            
            dp0 = Math.max(prev0, prev2);            
            dp1 = Math.max(prev1, prev0 - price);    
            dp2 = prev1 + price;
        }
        
        return (int)Math.max(dp0, dp2);
    }
}
