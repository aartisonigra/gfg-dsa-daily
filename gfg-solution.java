 PROBLEAM:

Given an undirected, weighted graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges, represented by 2d array edges[][], where edges[i]=[u, v, w] represents the edge between the nodes u and v having w edge weight.
You have to find the shortest distance of all the vertices from the source vertex src, and return an array of integers where the ith element denotes the shortest distance between ith node and source vertex src.

Note: The Graph is connected and doesn't contain any negative weight edge.

Examples:

Input: V = 3, edges[][] = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 6]], src = 2
Output: [4, 3, 0]
Explanation:

Shortest Paths:
For 2 to 0 minimum distance will be 4. By following path 2 -> 1 -> 0
For 2 to 1 minimum distance will be 3. By following path 2 -> 1
For 2 to 2 minimum distance will be 0. By following path 2 -> 2
Input: V = 5, edges[][] = [[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 8], [1, 4, 6], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 10]], src = 0
Output: [0, 4, 8, 10, 10]
Explanation: 

Shortest Paths: 
For 0 to 1 minimum distance will be 4. By following path 0 -> 1
For 0 to 2 minimum distance will be 8. By following path 0 -> 2
For 0 to 3 minimum distance will be 10. By following path 0 -> 2 -> 3 
For 0 to 4 minimum distance will be 10. By following path 0 -> 1 -> 4


SOLUTION :

class Solution {
    
    static class Pair {
        int node;
        int weight;
        Pair(int node, int weight) {
            this.node = node;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    public int[] dijkstra(int V, int[][] edges, int src) {
        // Step 1: Graph in adjacency list format
        List<List<Pair>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
            adj.get(u).add(new Pair(v, w));
            adj.get(v).add(new Pair(u, w)); // undirected graph
        }

        // Step 2: Distance array and min-heap
        int[] dist = new int[V];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[src] = 0;

        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.weight - b.weight);
        pq.add(new Pair(src, 0));

        // Step 3: Dijkstra's main logic
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Pair current = pq.poll();
            int u = current.node;

            for (Pair neighbor : adj.get(u)) {
                int v = neighbor.node;
                int weight = neighbor.weight;

                if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                    pq.add(new Pair(v, dist[v]));
                }
            }
        }

        return dist;
    }
}
