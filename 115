Special character of the string
Problem Statement
Ram was learning about strings, he read from the internet and got to know that the string is a series of characters. He was solving a problem and he got stuck and asked you for his help.

The problem defined a special character of the string as the first nonrepeating character in the string.

Given a string find the special character in it.

Input Format
The first line contains ‘n’, the number of characters in the string.

The following line contains the input string.

Output Format
If the special character exists, then print it else if it doesn’t exist print -1.

Constraints
1<=n<=106

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
4
aabb
Testcase Output
-1
Explanation
The given string is aabb there is no non-repeating character in the string, hence a special character does not exist in the string and we print -1.

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
10
abcbasdasd
Testcase Output
c
Explanation
The given string is abcbasdasd the first non-repeating character in the string is ‘c’ hence it is a special character.


SOLUTIONS:



import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static char user_logic(int n, String s) {
        // Frequency array (ASCII characters range)
        int[] freq = new int[256];

        // Count frequency of each character
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            freq[s.charAt(i)]++;
        }

        // Find first non-repeating character
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (freq[s.charAt(i)] == 1) {
                return s.charAt(i);
            }
        }

        // If not found
        return (char) -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        String s = scanner.next();

        char result = user_logic(n, s);

        if (result == (char) -1) {
            System.out.println("-1");
        } else {
            System.out.println(result);
        }
    }
}
