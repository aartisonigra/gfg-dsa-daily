Koko is given an array arr[], where each element represents a pile of bananas. She has exactly k hours to eat all the bananas.

Each hour, Koko can choose one pile and eat up to s bananas from it.

If the pile has atleast s bananas, she eats exactly s bananas.
If the pile has fewer than s bananas, she eats the entire pile in that hour.

Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.


Your task is to find the minimum value of s (bananas per hour) such that Koko can finish all the piles within k hours.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 3], k = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: If Koko eats at the rate of 5 bananas per hour:
First pile of 5 bananas will be finished in 1 hour.
Second pile of 10 bananas will be finished in 2 hours.
Third pile of 3 bananas will be finished in 1 hours.
Therefore, Koko can finish all piles of bananas in 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 hours.
Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 15, 20], k = 7
Output: 10
Explanation: If Koko eats at the rate of 10 bananas per hour, it will take 6 hours to finish all the piles


  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public int kokoEat(int[] arr, int k) {

        int low = 1;
        int high = 0;

        // Find maximum pile
        for (int bananas : arr) {
            high = Math.max(high, bananas);
        }

        int ans = high;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // current speed

            long hours = 0;

            // Calculate total hours needed with speed = mid
            for (int bananas : arr) {
                hours += (bananas + mid - 1) / mid;
            }

            if (hours <= k) {
                ans = mid;        // possible answer
                high = mid - 1;   // try smaller speed
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;    // need higher speed
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
