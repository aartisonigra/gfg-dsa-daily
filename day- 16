PROBLEAMS:

Given an array arr[] of size n, filled with numbers from 1 to n-1 in random order. The array has only one repetitive element. Your task is to find the repetitive element.

Note: It is guaranteed that there is a repeating element present in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 3 
Explanation: The number 3 is the only repeating element.
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1  
Explanation: The number 1 is the only repeating element.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1]  
Output: 1
Explanation: The array is of size 2 with both elements being 1, making 1 the repeating element.

SOLUTIONS:

class solution{
  public int findDuplicate(int[] arr){
    int xor = 0;
    int n = arr.length;

    for(int i = 0;i < n;i++){
      xor ^= arr[i];
    }
    for(int i = 1;i <= n - 1;i++){
      xor ^= i;
    }
    return xor;
  }
}
