Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a. Just write the code to swap values of a and b at the specified place.

Examples

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Initially a = 1 and b = 2, now a = 2 and b = 1.
Input: a = 6, b = 7  
Output: 7 6 
Explanation: Initially a = 6 and b = 7, now a = 7 and b = 6.

  SOLUTIONS:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class GFG {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //input a and b 
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
       
       // swap the teo numbers
        int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
        

        System.out.println(a + " " + b);
    }
}
