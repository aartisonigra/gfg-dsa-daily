Given an integer n, the task is to count the number of binary strings of length n that contains at least one pair of consecutive 1's.
Note: A binary string is a sequence made up of only 0's and 1's.

Examples:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 strings of length 2, the strings are 00, 01, 10, and 11. Only the string 11 has consecutive 1's.
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 8 strings of length 3, the strings are 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 and 111. The strings with consecutive 1's are 011, 110 and 111.
Input: n = 5
Output: 19
Explanation: There are 19 strings having at least one pair of consecutive 1's.

class Solution {
    public int countConsec(int n) {
        // code here
        
        if(n <= 0) return 0;
        
        int[] a = new int[n + 1];
        int[] b = new int[n + 1];
        
        a[1] = 1;
        b[1] = 1;
        
        for(int i = 2;i <= n; i++){
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + b[i - 1];
            b[i] = a[i - 1];
        }
        
        int validWithoutConsecutiveOnes = a[n] + b[n];
        int total = (int)Math.pow(2, n);
        
        return total -  validWithoutConsecutiveOnes;
    }
}
