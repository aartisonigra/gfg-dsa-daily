Given a positive number n and a number d. Find the count of positive numbers smaller or equal to n such that the difference between the number and sum of its digits is greater than or equal to given specific value d.

Examples:

Input: n = 13, d = 2
Output: 4
Explanation:
There are 4 numbers satisfying the
Conditions. These are 10, 11, 12 and 13.
Input: n = 14, d = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
There are 5 numbers satisfying the
Conditions. These are 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.


  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    
    // Function to calculate sum of digits
    private int sumOfDigits(long num) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    public int getCount(int n, int d) {
        
        long low = 1, high = n;
        long ans = -1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            long value = mid - sumOfDigits(mid);
            
            if (value >= d) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;  // try smaller number
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        if (ans == -1) return 0;
        
        return (int)(n - ans + 1);
    }
}
