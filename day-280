Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that -
      i. Each student gets exactly one packet.
     ii. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum and return that minimum possible difference.

Examples:

Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12], m = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing following m packets :[3, 4, 9, 7, 9].
Input: arr = [7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56], m = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 4 - 2 = 2 by choosing following m packets :[3, 2, 4].
Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56], m = 5
Output: 55
Explanation: With 5 packets for 5 students, each student will receive one packet, so the difference is 56 - 1 = 55.



  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    findMinDiff(arr, m) {
        let n = arr.length;

        // Edge cases
        if (m === 0 || n === 0) return 0;
        if (m > n) return -1; // students > packets → impossible

        // Step 1: Sort array
        arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

        // Step 2: Initialize min_diff
        let min_diff = Infinity;

        // Step 3: Sliding window
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {
            let diff = arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i];
            if (diff < min_diff) min_diff = diff;
        }

        // Step 4: Return result
        return min_diff;
    }
}
