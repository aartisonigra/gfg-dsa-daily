Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a star pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a star pattern.

Examples:


  *

  SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    void printDiamond(int n) {
        // Increasing part
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        
        // Decreasing part
        for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
