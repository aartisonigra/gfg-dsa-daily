Given two strings s1 and s2. You have to check that s1 is a subsequence of s2 or not.
Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "AXY", s2 = "YADXCP"
Output: false
Explanation: s1 is not a subsequence of s2 as 'Y' appears before 'A'.
Input: s1 = "gksrek", s2 = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: true
Explanation: If we combine the bold character of "geeksforgeeks", it equals to s1. So s1 is a subsequence of s2. 

SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public boolean isSubSeq(String s1, String s2) {
        // code here
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        
        while(i < s1.length() && j < s2.length()){
            if(s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)){
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return (i == s1.length());
    }
};
